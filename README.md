## Introduction
This list aims to be a curate list focusing on the **systematic bias rooted in deep learning models**. Let's start by defining bias as the disparity between the model prediction and the reality. (In the later part of this list, we would give more accurate definitions for bias under different senarios.)

The list is organized as follows:  
- [Categories](#Categories): a short summary on different aspects or manifestation of bias in deep learning.
- [Causes](#Causes): theories, conjectures or evidence on the root causes of the bias.  
- [Solutions](#Solutions): practical solutions or mitigating strategies for the bias.
