## Introduction
Compared to an exhaustive literature review on bias in deep learning, this list aims to be a curated list focusing on the manifestation, causes and solutions for the **systematic bias rooted in deep learning models**. p.s. Social bias (e.g. gender bias) will not be discussed much in this repository. *To be continued...*

The list is organized as follows:  
- [Categories](#Categories): different aspects or manifestation of bias in deep learning.
- [Causes](#Causes): theories, conjectures or evidence on the root causes of the bias.  
- [Solutions](#Solutions): practical solutions or mitigating strategies for the bias.
